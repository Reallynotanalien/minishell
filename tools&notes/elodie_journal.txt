Doing :
1 : fixing substitution Function (test everything + write down tests)

To do next :
Test how th git works
Exit and clean functions
Initiation struct et free

Done :
Added int exstat in struct (to be handled at execution)
fixing substitution Function (Fixing variables beside one another ($USER$USER)), 
	(add redirections as delimiters), (Handle correctly non-existing variable), (Make it so it changes use_data()->line_cpy)
	(handle variables substituing other variables), (Handle $?)
Created elodie-beta branch to safely work on do_substitutions
Fixing git situation
Remove whitespaces before and after str function
Token_parsing function
Create a line with only the necessary whitespaces, before tokenisation
Verify if all quotes are closed (before tokenisation)

To discuss :
Added int exstat in struct (to be handled at execution)
Git (malord)
data->quote_flag : Useful ?
data->error_flag : Defaults to 0 ? (For init) + Check Init !

Done :
Had pipex corrected
Corrected CPP01
Bouée de sauvetage

To do next :
Functions file

To discuss :
Begin with execution ? (easier for parsing)
Codes d'erreur, return status

if token starts with '/' '.', do not look through PATH. 
Otherwise search through path (then access to see if it is an executable or not.) 
If access does not find anything, check character in front to see if it is supposed to be a file

Parse environment, formattage (unexistant infile, pipe leading nowhere, unclosed "....), error in execve 
Make sure what we are doing is asked for, avoid unnecessary work

current working directory of a process affects the relative path
Add #include <sys/types.h> #include <unistd.h> to .h (for stat function)
When a string is returned by a function (ex : ttyname, strerror), it should be copied for storage and editing.
