----- New functions ------

-readline-  char *readline (const char *prompt); #(main loop)#

Reads a line from the terminal and return it, using
'prompt' as a prompt*. The line returned is allocated with malloc(3) and has the
final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.

If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no
prompt is issued.

readline returns the text of the line read.
A blank line returns the empty string.
If EOF is encountered while reading a line, and the line is empty, NULL is returned.
If an EOF is read with a non-empty line, it is treated as a newline.

More info : The GNU Readline Library and The GNU History Library

~/.inputrc : Individual readline initialization file

Readline provides commands for searching through the command history for lines containing a specified string.
There are two search modes: incremental and non-incremental.

readline offers editing capabilities while the user is entering the line.

*Prompt : A string or character printed in the terminal to indicate that the program is ready to receive input.
The input is usually written after the prompt. (Ex : "bash-3.2$" is a prompt)



-rl_clear_history-  void clear_history(void) (**or rl_clear_history) #(main loop)#

Clears the history stored by readline (add_history) in the history buffer.



-rl_on_new_line-  variable (flag) #(Probably won't need it, main loop)#

A flag used to determine if the GNU Readline library should act as if the cursor is on a new line.
If the value is non-zero, readline will behave as if the cursor is at the beginning of a new line even if it isn't.
Has to be set manually (rl_on_new_line = 1), which can be useful to customize the behavior of readline.



-rl_replace_line-  void  rl_replace_line(Probably won't need it, const char *text, int clear_undo) #(main loop)#

Useful to customize further the usage of the prompt. 
Used to replace the the current line of text being edited in the readline buffer with 'text'.
'clear_undo' determines if the undo history should be cleared (1) or not (0) after replacement.
Used with rl_redisplay.
Undo history refers to a feature which allows users to undo their previous edits or actions while editing a line.



-rl_redisplay-	void rl_redisplay(void); #(Probably won't need it, main loop)#

Used to redraw or update (refresh) the input line*.
Can be called after changes were made through user input or program actions.

*input line : essentially the line of text that the user is typing or editing in response to the program's prompt.



-add_history-	void add_history(const char *string); #(main loop)#

Used to add a line ('string') to the command history*. 
This way, the user can navigate their previous commands with the up and down arrows.

*command history : A feature of the readline library which manages previous commands given by the user.



-wait3-	pid_t wait3(int *status, int options, struct rusage *rusage); #(Execution)#

Used to wait for the termination of child processes 
and retrieve information about their exit status and resource utilization.

>status (int)**: A pointer to an integer where the exit status of the terminated child process will be stored.
>options (int): This argument allows you to specify various options for controlling the behavior of the wait3 function. (see man)
>rusage (struct rusage)**: This is an optional pointer to a struct rusage object, 
which is used to store resource utilization information about the terminated child process. 

Return Value (pid_t): The function returns the process ID (PID) of the terminated child process on success. 
It returns -1 on error, and errno is set to indicate the specific error.



-wait4-	pid_t wait4(pid_t pid, int *status, int options, struct rusage *rusage); #(Execution)#

Very similar to wait3, except :
>pid (pid_t): This argument specifies the process ID (PID) of the child process for which you want to wait. 
If pid is set to -1, wait4 behaves similarly to waitpid, waiting for any child process. 
If pid is set to 0, it waits for any child in the same process group as the caller. 
If pid is greater than 0, it waits for the child with the specified PID.



-signal-	void (*signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)))(int);	#(signals)#

Sets up signal* handlers. Whenever "signum" signal is received 
(for exemple 'SIGINT' which corresponds to Ctrl+C), 'handler' function is called.

The signal function returns a function pointer to the previous signal handler for the specified signal. 
This allows you to save the previous handler, if needed.

The handler function typically takes an integer argument, which is the signal number.
The last int ((int)) indicates the data type of the return value of the signal function. In this case, 
it specifies that the return value of signal is a pointer to a function that takes an int argument and returns void.

*Signals are a way for processes to communicate with each other or with the operating system. 
They can be used for various purposes, such as handling errors, responding to user interrupts (e.g., Ctrl+C),
and more.



-sigaction-	int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact); #(signals)#

Same as signal, but gives more control over signal handling behabior.
Can be used to specify which threads will handle a signal, for exemple. 

>act : pointer to a struct sigaction that specifies the new action to be taken when the specified signal is received.
(see man for more informations)
>oldact : oldact: This is an optional pointer to a struct sigaction that can be used to retrieve 
the previous action associated with the signal.



-sigemptyset- int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set); #(signals)#

sigemptyset function is used to initialize an empty signal set*.
Used with sigaddset

*signal set : data structures used to represent sets of signals that a process 
is interested in or needs to manipulate.



-sigaddset- int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum); #(signals)#

Adds a specific signal to a signal set.



-kill- int kill(pid_t pid, int sig); #(execution, other)#

Used to send signals to a specified process or process group. 
It allows one process to send a signal to another process or group of processes, 
which can be used for various purposes, such as process termination, communication, and synchronization.

>pid: The process ID (PID) of the target process or process group to which the signal is sent.
If pid ==...
	greater than 0 : represents a specific process
	0 : The signal is sent to all processed in the same process group as the calling process
   -1 : The signal is sent to all processes for which the calling process has permissions to send signals
	less than -1 : absolute value of pid represents a process group ID. Signal will be sent to all of it's members



-getcwd-	char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size); #(builtins)#

Used to retrieve the current working directory of a process. 

>buf : A pointer to a buffer where the cwd will be stored as a char *. If NULL, it will be allocated with malloc.
>size : the size of buf

Returns the adress of the buffer where the information is stored on sucess, or NULL on failure.



-chdir-	int chdir(const char *path); #(builtins)#

Used to change the current working directory of a process.

Returns 0 on success or -1 and sets errno on failure.



-stat-	int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf); #(?)#

Used to retrieve information about a file, such as its status or attributes. 
It provides detailed information about a file, including its size, permissions, 
timestamps (modification, access, and change times), and more.

>path: The path to the file or directory for which to retrieve information
>buf : A buffer to a struct stat where the information will be stored.

Returns 0 on success or -1 and sets errno on failure.

-lstat- int lstat(const char *path, struct stat *buf); #(?)#

Basically the same as stat, except when it comes to handling symbolic links.
If  used on a symbolic link, stat it gives information on the link's target 
while lstat gives information on the link itself.



-fstat-	int fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf); #(?)#

Basically the same as stat (including symbolic link handling), except it uses an open file's fd.



-unlink-	int unlink(const char *pathname); #(?)#

Used to remove (delete) a file from the filesystem.
It is permanently removed from the file system, and its disk space is freed.

Returns 0 on success or -1 and sets errno on failure



-opendir-	DIR *opendir(const char *dirname); #(?)#

Used to open a directory for reading.
Can be used to read the list of files and subdirectories.

>dirname : the name of the directory to be opened.

Returns a pointer to a DIR structure on success, which is used to represent the opened directory.
Returns NULL on failure and sets errno.

To be used with readdir and closedir. (Basically useless on it's own)



-readdir-	struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp); #(?)#

Used to read the contents of an opened directory.
It reads the next directory entry for the specified directory (dirp).

Returns a pointer to a struct dirent containing information about the entry.

-closedir-	int closedir(DIR *dirp); #(?)#

Used to release the ressources allocated with opendir and ensure no more operations can be executed on the specified directory (dirp)

Returns 0 on sucess and -1 on failure (sets errno).



-strerror-	char *strerror(int errnum); #(Error management)#

Takes an error code as an argument and returns a pointer to a null-terminated string that describes the error.
Said string is NOT allocated using malloc, and therefore should not be freed.
Returns NULL if the error code was not recognized.

-isatty-	int isatty(int fd); #(parsing ?)#

Used to determine if fd is connected to a terminal.

Returns 1 if the fd is connected to a terminal and 0 if it is not.
Returns -1 if an error occurs or the fd is invalid, and sets errno.



-ttyname-	char *ttyname(int fd);	#(?)#

Used to determine the name of the terminal device associated with a given file descriptor.

Returns a pointer to a string representing the name of the terminal, or NULL on error.

-tgetnum-	int tgetnum(const char *id); #(?)#

Used to retrieve numeric capabilities or values associated with a specified terminal type.

>id: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the name of the capability you want to retrieve.

The tgetnum function searches the terminal's capabilities and attributes for the specified numeric capability identified by id 
and returns its numeric value as an integer. If the specified capability is not defined for the terminal, it returns -1 to indicate an error.



-tgetstr-	char *tgetstr(const char *id, char **area); #(?)#

Used to retrieve string capabilities or sequences associated with a specified terminal type.

>id: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the name of the capability or sequence you want to retrieve.
>area: A pointer to a pointer to a buffer. tgetstr may allocate memory for the capability or sequence and store it in this buffer.
